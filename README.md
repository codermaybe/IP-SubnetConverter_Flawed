# SubnetConverter_Flawed
this is a simple program written by chatgpt,for the purpose of convert ip and subnet into another format
the program can convert string like "192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0" into "192.168.1.1/24"

# How To USE
1. prepare your Rust Environment
2. Use "Cargo new"+ Project_NAME in cmd to build your simple project
3. replace input_file_path variable with your target TXT file ï¼Œthe file format can be seen in the Example_Input.txt,white space between ip and mask doesn't matter.
4. get Output File in the project folder,or the path you demand

# Why this is a flawed project

-- I have learned a lot on Rust Programming,and to be honest i don't think I'm incapable of making this program more robust or having more functions.
-- But i know that i cant finish this job in serval seconds,which i did when chat with the goddamn gpt.
-- Even more, it took serval minutes to generate this project is my fault.It was my problem that I didn't express my demands precisely.
-- It's just frustrated for me to see the sign that gpt has the real ablility to repalce a lot of codeworkers(or maybe runoobs just like me).
